Read your Man pages in PDF format. Even Online!

https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/manpdf/assets/88276600/0ca95ba0-54a8-4113-82f7-dfb58fb41cd9

## Installation

Download the scripts and make them executable by running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/manpdf
cd manpdf
make
```

This will install by default in `/usr/local/bin`, which should be on your `$PATH`.

If you want to install in another location, like `$HOME/.local/bin`, run `make prefix=~/.local`. 

## Uninstallation

Simply run `make uninstall`.

## Example

To view the man page for `ls` in PDF format, run:

```shell
manpdf ls
```

You can download a man page from the web. Fox example, to view the man page for `systemd` in the latest version of Arch, btw, run:

```shell
manweb systemd
````

This also supports PDF

```shell
manweb systemd --pdf
````

## Requirements

ManPDF and ManWEB should work everywhere. The only requirements (which should already be installed in your system anyway) are:
 - A `man` implementation (`man-db`, `mandoc`, or even that old non-GPL implementation on macOS),
 - `groff`, 
 - `curl`,
 - `gzip`, to handle distros that compress man pages by default, and
 - `open` or `xdg-open` associated with an application that can open PDFs. (Optional: you can also pass your preferred PDF viewer)

## Thanks to
- [Argbash](https://argbash.io/) for generating the CLI parser.
- [Groff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) for generating the PDF.
- [Manned.org](https://manned.org/) for the best online man pages.
