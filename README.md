Read your Man pages in PDF format. Even Online!

https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/manpdf/assets/88276600/0ca95ba0-54a8-4113-82f7-dfb58fb41cd9

## Installation

Download the scripts and make them executable by running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/manpdf
cd manpdf
make
```

This will install by default in `/usr/local/bin`, which should be on your `$PATH`.

If you want to install in another location, like `$HOME/.local/bin`, run `make prefix=~/.local`. 

## Uninstallation

Simply run `make uninstall`.

## Example

To view the man page for `ls` in PDF format, run:

```shell
manpdf ls
```

You can download a man page from the web. Fox example, to view the man page for `systemd` in the latest version of Arch, btw, run:

```shell
manweb systemd
````

This also supports PDF

```shell
manweb systemd --pdf
````

## Usage

```
ManPDF - Open a man page as a PDF file.

manpdf [-o|--output <arg>] [--(no-)omanpdf [-o|--output <arg>] [--pdf-viewer <arg>] [--(no-)open-pdf] [-d|--(no-)debug] [-h|--help] [-v|--version] <name-or-file> [<section>]
        <name-or-file>: You can pass either the name of the man page, a man page file (local or URL), or "-" to read file from stdin
        -o, --output: The output file (no default)
        --pdf-viewer: The command to open the PDF file (defaults to "xdg-open" or "open" if not provided) (no default)
        --open-pdf, --no-open-pdf: Open the PDF file after creating it (on by default)
        -d, --debug, --no-debug: Print debug information too (off by default)
        -h, --help: Prints this help
        -v, --version: Prints version
```

```
ManWEB - Open a man page from Manned.org

manweb [-p|--(no-)pdf] [-w|--(no-)where] [-d|--(no-)debug] [-t|--(no-)try-local] [-o|--output <arg>] [--pdf-viewer <arg>] [-h|--help] <name-or-url> [<section>]
        <name-or-url>: You can pass either the name of the man page, the URL to a manned.org page, or the URL to any raw man page in roff format (hosted at manned.org or not)
        -p, --pdf, --no-pdf: If passed, the script will not open the man page, it will just open it as a PDF. (off by default)
        -w, --where, --no-where: Don't actually show the man page, but print the URL of the matching page, if found. (off by default)
        -d, --debug, --no-debug: Print debug information too (off by default)
        -t, --try-local, --no-try-local: If there's a local man page available, don't try to fetch from network (on by default)
        -o, --output: The output file. If passed, the script will not open the man page, it will just save it to disk in roff format. When combined with the --pdf option, it will save the PDF to the provided filename. (no default)
        --pdf-viewer: The command to open the PDF file (defaults to "xdg-open" or "open" if not provided) (no default)
        -h, --help: Prints this help
```

## Requirements

ManPDF and ManWEB should work everywhere. The only requirements (which should already be installed in your system anyway) are:
 - A `man` implementation (`man-db`, `mandoc`, or even that old non-GPL implementation on macOS),
 - `groff`, 
 - `curl`,
 - `gzip`, to handle distros that compress man pages by default, and
 - `open` or `xdg-open` associated with an application that can open PDFs. (Optional: you can also pass your preferred PDF viewer)

## Thanks to
- [Argbash](https://argbash.io/) for generating the CLI parser.
- [Groff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) for generating the PDF.
- [Manned.org](https://manned.org/) for the best online man pages.
